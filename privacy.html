        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of the Ruhr University Bochum. The use of the Internet pages of the Ruhr University Bochum is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.</p>

        <p>The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the Ruhr University Bochum. By means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.</p>

        <p>As the controller, the Ruhr University Bochum has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone. </p>

        <h4>1. Definitions</h4>
        <p>The data protection declaration of the Ruhr University Bochum is based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and business partners. To ensure this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.</p>

        <p>In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:</p>

        <ul style="list-style: none">
            <li>
                <h4>a) Personal data</h4>
                <p>Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>b) Data subject</h4>

                <p>Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>d) Restriction of processing</h4>
                <p>Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>e) Profiling</h4>
                <p>Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>f) Pseudonymisation</h4>
                <p>Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>g) Controller or controller responsible for the processing</h4>
                <p>Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>h) Processor</h4>
                <p>Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>i) Recipient</h4>
                <p>Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>j) Third party</h4>
                <p>Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>k) Consent</h4>
                <p>Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. Name and Address of the controller</h4>

        </p>

        <p>Ruhr-Universität Bochum</p>
        <p>Universitätsstraße 150</p>
        <p>44801 Bochum</p>
        <p>Deutschland</p>
        <p>Phone: +49 234 32 201</p>
        <p>Email: webmaster@ruhr-uni-bochum.de</p>
        <p>Website: www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de</p>

        <h4>3. Name and Address of the Data Protection Officer</h4>
        <p>The Data Protection Officer of the controller is:</p>

        Dr. Kai-Uwe Loser
        <p>Ruhr-Universität Bochum</p>
        <p>Universitätsstraße 150</p>
        <p>44801 Bochum</p>
        <p>Deutschland</p>
        <p>Phone: +49 234 32 28720</p>
        <p>Email: dsb@rub.de</p>
        <p>Website: www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de</p>

        <p>Any data subject may, at any time, contact our Data Protection Officer directly with all questions and suggestions concerning data protection.</p>

        <h4>4. Collection of general data and information</h4>
        <p>The website of the Ruhr University Bochum collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in the server log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.</p>

        <p>When using these general data and information, the Ruhr University Bochum does not draw any conclusions about the data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack. Therefore, the Ruhr University Bochum analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.</p>

        <h4>5. Routine erasure and blocking of personal data</h4>
        <p>The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.</p>

        <p>If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.</p>

        <h4>6. Rights of the data subject</h4>
        <ul style="list-style: none;">
            <li>
                <h4>a) Right of confirmation</h4>
                <p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed.

                </ul>
                <p>If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to request the erasure of personal data stored by the Ruhr University Bochum, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller. An employee of Ruhr University Bochum shall promptly ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately.</p>

                <p>Where the controller has made personal data public and is obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other controllers processing the personal data that the data subject has requested erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data, as far as processing is not required. An employees of the Ruhr University Bochum will arrange the necessary measures in individual cases.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>e) Right of restriction of processing</h4>
                <p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data. </li>
                    <li>The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of their use instead.</li>
                    <li>The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>
                    <li>The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal data stored by the Ruhr University Bochum, he or she may at any time contact any employee of the controller. The employee of the Ruhr University Bochum will arrange the restriction of the processing. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>f) Right to data portability</h4>
                <p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator, to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which was provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. He or she shall have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject shall have the right to have personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>

                <p>In order to assert the right to data portability, the data subject may at any time contact any employee of the Ruhr University Bochum.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>g) Right to object</h4>
                <p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time, to processing of personal data concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This also applies to profiling based on these provisions.</p>

                <p>The Ruhr University Bochum shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>

                <p>If the Ruhr University Bochum processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing. This applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. If the data subject objects to the Ruhr University Bochum to the processing for direct marketing purposes, the Ruhr University Bochum will no longer process the personal data for these purposes.</p>

                <p>In addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her by the Ruhr University Bochum for scientific or historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.</p>

                <p>In order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may contact any employee of the Ruhr University Bochum. In addition, the data subject is free in the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to use his or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>h) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling</h4>
                <p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects him or her, as long as the decision (1) is not is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the data subject's explicit consent.</p>

                <p>If the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) it is based on the data subject's explicit consent, the Ruhr University Bochum shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and contest the decision.</p>

                <p>If the data subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated individual decision-making, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the Ruhr University Bochum.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>i) Right to withdraw data protection consent </h4>
                <p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to withdraw his or her consent to processing of his or her personal data at any time. </p>

                <p>If the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the consent, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the Ruhr University Bochum.</p>

            </li>

        <h4>7. Legal basis for the processing </h4>
        <p>Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator. He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).

        <h4>8. The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party</h4>
        <p>Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.</p>

        <h4>9. Period for which the personal data will be stored</h4>
        <p>The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.</p>

        <h4>10. Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible consequences of failure to provide such data </h4>
        <p>We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee. The employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.

        <h4>11. Existence of automated decision-making</h4>
        <p>As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.</p>
